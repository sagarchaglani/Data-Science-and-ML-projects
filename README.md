# Data Science Projects Overview

This repository contains a collection of eight data science projects completed by learners. Each project consists of four self-paced lessons, followed by a programmatically graded assignment. To pass each assessment, students must achieve a score of 90% or better.

## Projects

### 1. Housing in Mexico
- **Description**: Learners analyze a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine if real estate prices are more influenced by property size or location.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Data import and cleaning from a CSV file
  - Building data visualizations
  - Correlation analysis to examine relationships between variables

### 2. Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires
- **Description**: Learners build a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Creating data pipelines for data cleaning (imputation and encoding)
  - Building and optimizing linear regression models
  - Reducing overfitting to improve model performance

### 3. Air Quality in Nairobi
- **Description**: Learners create an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Extracting data from MongoDB using `pymongo`
  - Building and tuning time-series models
  - Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

### 4. Earthquake Damage in Nepal
- **Description**: Learners develop logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Data extraction from SQLite databases
  - Building and comparing classification models
  - Identifying and addressing data biases to prevent discrimination

### 5. Bankruptcy in Poland
- **Description**: Learners build random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Navigating the Linux command line
  - Addressing imbalanced data through resampling techniques
  - Understanding and evaluating models with performance metrics (precision and recall)

### 6. Customer Segmentation in the US
- **Description**: Learners create a k-means model to cluster US consumers into distinct groups.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data visualization
  - Developing interactive dashboards with Plotly Dash
  - Implementing clustering algorithms for customer segmentation

### 7. A/B Testing at WorldQuant University
- **Description**: Learners conduct a chi-square test to assess if sending an email can increase program enrollment at WQU.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Building custom Python classes for ETL processes
  - Conducting A/B tests and hypothesis testing
  - Creating interactive data applications following a three-tiered design pattern

### 8. Volatility Forecasting in India
- **Description**: Learners develop a GARCH time series model to predict asset volatility.
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Acquiring and cleaning stock data through an API
  - Storing and managing data in a SQLite database
  - Building and deploying a custom API to serve model predictions

## Usage
Each project folder contains:
- Data used for the project (where applicable)
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling
- Relevant scripts and modules used in the process

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.x)
- Required Python packages (listed in each project's `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
